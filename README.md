# Advanced Very Large Scale Integration (AVLSI) Project

The AVLSI project involved the schematic and layout design of a CPL_Full_Adder using Electric software, followed by simulations in ModelSim INTEL FPGA software using Verilog programming. The project encompassed multiple phases, including error checking and rectification.

## Project Highlights:

- **CPL_Full_Adder Design:** The core of this project was the design of a CPL (Complementary Pass-Logic) Full Adder, a fundamental component in digital circuitry. 

- **Simulations:** Extensive simulations were performed in ModelSim â€“ INTEL FPGA Starter Edition Software to verify the functionality and performance of the CPL Full Adder.

- **Error Checking and Rectification:** Stringent error checking, including ERC (Electrical Rule Check) and DRC (Design Rule Check), was carried out, and any identified errors were rectified to ensure a robust design.

- **Design Parameters:**
  - W/L of NMOS = 5/2
  - W/L of PMOS = 10/2
  - W/L ratio of PMOS to NMOS = 2
  - Minimum spacing between actives and polysilicon: 3 micrometers
  - Achieved zero DRC errors
  - Achieved zero ERC errors
  - No NCC (Netlist Conformance Check) errors
  
- **Building Logic Gates:** The project also involved the construction of logic gates using PMOS and NMOS transistors, including a NOT gate.

- **Total Transistors:** The CPL Full Adder design comprised a total of 32 transistors, with 24 NMOS and 8 PMOS transistors.

- **Software Proficiency:** The project provided valuable experience in using Electric Tool for schematic and layout design and ModelSim Software for Verilog simulations.
